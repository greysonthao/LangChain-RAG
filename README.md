# Simple RAG pipeline using `LangChain.js`

This repository contains the JavaScript version of the python RAG implementation by **Jodie Burchell**
as demoed in her [Beyond the Hype: A Realistic Look at Large Language Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv0cfsastFs) GOTO 2024 presentation.

- [Original repository](https://github.com/t-redactyl/simple-rag-document-qa) (Make sure to star)

## Prerequisites

If you intend to use a local LLM through Ollama, you will need to install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and the [llama3 LLM model](https://ollama.com/library/llama3) via Ollama. You will also need to install the [all-minilm](https://ollama.com/library/all-minilm) embeddings model, also via Ollama.

To ensure that you have successfully downloaded and installed all of the above, run the following commands through your terminal:

- Check whether Ollama is installed: `ollama --version`

- Check whether the required models are available: `ollama list`

## Key differences between the [original python repository](https://github.com/t-redactyl/simple-rag-document-qa/tree/main) and the JavaScript version 

- This is **not** a Jupyter Notebook.

- This code uses two types of Vector stores instead of one. The original code used the `ChromaDB` vector store, whereas this repo contains code using `ChromaDB` but also code using the In-memory vector store module provided by `LangChain.js`.

- The original code used OpenAI's API to connect with a remote LLM. This code uses OpenAI along with Anthropic's Claude and also uses a local LLM powered by Ollama. In this last case, the code uses OllamaEmbeddings which in turn uses the `all-minilm` embeddings model instead of OpenAIEmbeddings.

- The `nDocuments` variable found in the original code has been renamed to `kDocuments`.

- The original code used the `CharacterSplitter` for splitting the PDF documents, whereas this repo contains a variation using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.

- The original repo contains a large PDF (pycharm-documentation.pdf which is around 174MB) that is used in the demo. This is a great source to test and also compare the results with the demo, but it turns out that it takes quite a lot of time to get vectorized. For testing purposes and making the process faster of vectorizing faster, especially in the case of the In-memory vector database which gets deleted every time the program gets restarted, a second smaller version of the original file has been added to the `/materials` folder. The file is called `pycharm-documentation-mini.pdf`, it's just 743KB and contains the first 10 pages of the original PDF. 

- Another PDF has been added for further testing. The file can be found in the `/materials` folder and it's named `MetaPrivacyPolicy.pdf`. It's around 4MB and contains the Meta's privacy policy as of 2024.

## Usage

- `git clone https://github.com/in-tech-gration/simple-rag-document-qa.git`
- `cd simple-rag-document-qa`
- `npm install`
- `node rag-pdf-qa.js`
